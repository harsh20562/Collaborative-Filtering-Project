# Collaborative-Filtering-Project
This work was done during Winter Semester at IIIT Delhi in the course CSE640-Collaborative Filtering under the guidance of Dr. 
Angshul Majumdar. 
<br />
<br />
In this project, we need to implement atleast 2 research papers from either Core A* conferences or RecSys conference or Elsevier journal with impact factor > 5 related to Recommendation Systems on different datasets as that of papers. In this project, we were a team of 5 students and we implemented 4 research papers. We implemented the following papers:-
1. Enhancing VAEs for Collaborative Filtering: Flexible Priors & Gating Mechanisms (https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.00936)
2. Variational Autoencoders for Collaborative Filtering (https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.05814)
3. AutoRec: Autoencoders Meet Collaborative Filtering (https://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~akmenon/papers/autorec/autorec-paper.pdf)
4. Training Deep AutoEncoders for Collaborative Filtering (https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.01715)
